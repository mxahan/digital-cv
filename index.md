## Introduction
---
I am Zahid Hasan, 3rd Year Ph.D. Student, IS Department, UMBC. I am pursueing my doctoral research under the supervision of [Dr. Nirmalya Roy](https://mpsc.umbc.edu/nroy) in [MPSC laboratory](https://mpsc.umbc.edu/home). 

## Research Interest
---
Machine learning, Deep learning, Self-supervised representation learning, computer vision, pattern recognition, Information theory, and their application to real-world problem-solving.

## Current Reserach
---
Developing robust methods for image and video understanding using unlabeled raw data and contributing to computer science by proposing and validating Machine learning algorithms. 

## News
---

One of our research work has been published in SPIE 2022.

Two of our paper got accepted in the [SmartComp 2022](https://mxahan.github.io/blog/).
