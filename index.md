## Introduction
---
I am Zahid Hasan, 3rd Year Ph.D. Student, IS Department, UMBC. I am pursueing my doctoral research under the supervision of [Dr. Nirmalya Roy](https://mpsc.umbc.edu/nroy) in [MPSC laboratory](https://mpsc.umbc.edu/home). 

## Research Interest
---
Machine learning, Deep learning, Self-supervised representation learning, computer vision, pattern recognition, Information theory, and their application to real-world problem-solving.

## Current Reserach
---
Developing robust methods for image and video understanding using unlabeled raw data and contributing to computer science by proposing and validating Machine learning algorithms.

## Experiences
---
- Lecturer Daffodil University (2015-2016) at Electrical and Electronic Engineering 
Responsibilities: Conducting Undergratuate EEE classes, Labs and Evaluation
Conducted Courses: Digital Signal Processing (DSP), Communication Theory
- Lecturer UAP (2016-2018) at Electrical and Electronic Engineering 
Responsibilities: Conducting Undergratuate EEE classes, Labs and Evaluation
Conducted Courses: Random Signal Processing (RSP), Advanced DSP, Communication Theory, Cellular Communication.
- Internship in Philips (May 2019 - December  2019)
Responsibilities: I conducted research under the supervision of Philips AI scientists to develop a robust clutter removal filter for heart ultrasound for better Doppler-based blood flow estimation. We propose a data-driven approach to avoid the computational heavy SVD method for clutter removal and acheive high performing model to estimate blood flow from noisy heart ultrasound.
- Research Assistant in UMBC (Spring 2020 - Ongoing)
- *Paper Review*: Reviewed several papers on PerCom, DMKD, Smartcomp, IEEE workshop on ML for Big data, IoT journal, PMC Journal
