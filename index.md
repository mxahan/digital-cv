## Introduction
---
I am Zahid Hasan, 3rd Year Ph.D. Student, IS Department, UMBC. I am pursueing my doctoral research under the supervision of [Dr. Nirmalya Roy](https://mpsc.umbc.edu/nroy) in [MPSC laboratory](https://mpsc.umbc.edu/home). 

## Research Interest
---
Machine learning, Deep learning, Self-supervised representation learning, computer vision, Information theory, and their application to real-world problem-solving. 

## Current Reserach
---
Developing robust methods for image and video understanding using unlabeled raw data and contributing to computer science by proposing and validating Machine learning algorithms. Particularly, I am looking into developing view-invariant vision system, and information preserving vision system from unlabeled data using self-supervised learning.

### Under review 
- both of our under review works are double blined. Will update it as soon as I get green signal. 

## Experiences
---
- Lecturer Daffodil University (2015-2016) at Electrical and Electronic Engineering 
Responsibilities: Conducting Undergratuate EEE classes, Labs and Evaluation
Conducted Courses: Digital Signal Processing (DSP), Communication Theory
- Lecturer UAP (2016-2018) at Electrical and Electronic Engineering 
Responsibilities: Conducting Undergratuate EEE classes, Labs and Evaluation
Conducted Courses: Random Signal Processing (RSP), Advanced DSP, Communication Theory, Cellular Communication.
- Internship in Philips (May 2019 - December  2019)
Responsibilities: I conducted research under the supervision of Philips AI scientists to develop a robust clutter removal filter for heart ultrasound for better Doppler-based blood flow estimation. We propose a data-driven approach to avoid the computational heavy SVD method for clutter removal and achieve high performing model to estimate blood flow from noisy heart ultrasound.

## Research Approach
---
- I am interested in finding and solving research gap.
- I would be spending my majority of my time to know the SoTA research while formulating ideas to address one of the research gap. 
- Create Hypothesis, State the underlying assumption, Create experimentation, Check if it aligns with the hypothesis, Back to creating hypothesis. 
  - Nutshell version!
